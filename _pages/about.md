About Me
=====
Hi! I am PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, advised by [Dylan Losey](https://dylanlosey.com/).
I am broadly interested in human-robot interaction, using machine learning to improve how robots collaborate with people.
Currently, I am a research assistant at [Collab](https://collab.me.vt.edu/).

Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/hcr-lab/) at the
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, with [Vineet Vashista](https://cogs.iitgn.ac.in/team/vineet-vashista/).
There I focused on developing control algorithms to facilitate human-in-the-loop operation of quadcopters
under physical constraints. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Nirma University in 2019.
