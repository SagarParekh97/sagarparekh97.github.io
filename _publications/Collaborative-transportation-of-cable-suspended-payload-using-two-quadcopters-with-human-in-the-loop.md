excerpt: 'We study the problem of collaborative transportation of cable-suspended payload using two quadcopters. While previous works on transportation using quadcopters emphasize more on autonomous control and generating complex trajectory, in this paper a master-slave strategy is implemented where the master quadcopter is controlled by human and the slave quadcopter tries to stabilize the oscillations of the payload. Two quadcopters with a cable-suspended payload system is under-actuated with coupled dynamics and hence, manual control is difficult. We use Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold for deriving equations of motion and apply variation based linearization to linearize the system. We designed a Lyapunov based controller to minimize the oscillations of the payload while transportation, leading to an easier manual control of master quadcopter.'
